# 9. Exercises

1- Assume a design that uses HP0 and HP1 in a Zynq UltraScale MPSoC to read data arrays simultaneously at the frequency of 200MHz. What would be the maximum memory bandwidth utilisation?

2- What is the upper bound of the memory utilisation for reading data from a DDR memory in Zynq 7000 at the frequency of 150MHz?
