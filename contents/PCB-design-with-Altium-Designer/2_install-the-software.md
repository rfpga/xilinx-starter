# 2. install the software

hi

Thank you so much for giving me this honor

as you know altium designer is not free software

for downloading it you can go to this url

https://www.altium.com/products/downloads

and for teaching purposes you can use trial version for this course

of course you can use cracked version but I don't recommend it and I can't teach that because it is against the rule of udemy

Sorry about that
