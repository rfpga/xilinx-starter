# PCB design with Altium Designer

-   [PCB design with Altium Designer](https://www.udemy.com/course/pcb-design-with-altium-designer-2022-latest-version/)  

First we will design Simple MCU based PCB like arduino with Cortex MCU next we design 3 complex and practical PCB

##  What you'll learn

-   Basic tool's of Altium Designer
-   Design professional PCB's
-   Design schematic like a pro
-   power supply
-   multi-sheet design
-   Placement and alignment
-   a lot more
